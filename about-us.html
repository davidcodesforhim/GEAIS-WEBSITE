            <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <p>The humble beginnings of Gen Emilio Aguinaldo Integrated School (High School Department) can be traced back to June 12, 1965 when the school was created through Executive Order No. 3. It was listed as the 24th secondary school
            </p>
            <p>The newest and the youngest then. It started as a mere annex of Ramon Magsaysay High School in Espa√±a. Two years after, it was transferred to R. Hidalgo, Quiapo. Then, on July 11, 1975, it was moved to the corner street of Arlegui, Quiapo.</p>
            <p>Initially, it had 228 freshmen, who became the first batch of Graduates four years after, at the graduation ceremonies held at Sebastian College Auditorium. Through its 22 years of existence, the school has been run successively by 24 school administrators. During the stay of Mr. Henry Panela, one of the four male principals assigned to the school, the high school department once more became an independent entity from the elementary school. Today, an over bridge connects the main and annex buildings. </p>
            <p>This confines the student inside the school campus and assures their security and safety within the school premises. Energized by high hopes and brighter dreams of the school administrator, the teachers, the students, and the local community, the school is moving towards a culture of excellence. It would indeed keep in step with progressive education. It would take up the challenges of the time. It would break off from restraining physical shackles and soar into the stratosphere of intellectual and social endeavor powered by its store of human resources.
            </p>

          <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Truly aiming high, GEAIS High School Department would take its place among the greats in training for leadership and in giving the students the skills and abilities they need to cope with the demands of the society in their time. It aims to equip them with the functional knowledge necessary for a useful, productive and happy life. </p>
            <p>At present, the high school department boasts of three academic buildings: one TLE-Voc. Annex Building. Bo. Puso Building, and the Senior High School Building. The Annex II Building in Barangay 905 for Senior High School (SHS) is under construction and 90% complete. It has 49 teachers and 11 support personnel. Ten among the teaching personnel are handling SHS or Grade 11 and 12 students. The school offers ICT and Home Economics strands under the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) track and Humanities and Social Sciences under the Academic track. It will also offer more tracks and strands to cater to our JHS completers and other students.</p>
